## About the Project
This project is divided into two parts:

### Part 1: Research Question
A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. She would now like to employ your services as a Data Science Consultant to help her identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads. 

This section will cover  unsupervised learning with R. The task for this section will be to create a supervised learning model to *help identify which individuals are most likely to click on the ads in the blog*. 


### Part 2: Research Question

This section of the assessment covers both supervised and unsupervised learning with R. 

Kira Plastinina (https://kiraplastinina.ru/) is a Russian brand that is sold through a defunct chain of retail stores in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippines, and Armenia. The brand’s Sales and Marketing team would like to understand their customer’s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year. More specifically, they would like to learn the characteristics of customer groups.

I will perform supervised learning techniques on the data and give insight on the findings along with recommendations. 
I will then proceed to perform clustering stating insights drawn from your analysis and visualizations.
I will then provide comparisons between the approaches learned this week i.e. K-Means clustering vs Hierarchical clustering highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach in the context of your analysis. 


## Practise Outcome
This project will help me gain more understanding and practise  on:
 * applying unsupervised learning algorithms to solving business problems.
 * applying the process of dimensionality reduction to a dataset.
 
 
 ## Technologies
 I analysed the data using R studio for windows version 4.0.3. 


## Scope
The Markdowns for each of the research question will comprise the following sections:

* Problem Definition
* Data Sourcing
* Check the Data
* Perform Data Cleaning
* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis  (Univariate, Bivariate & Multivariate)
* Implement the Solution
* Challenge the Solution
* Follow up Questions
